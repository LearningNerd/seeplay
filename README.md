# SeePlay

*Learn to sight-read sheet music! SeePlay teaches you to hear with your eyes and play from your heart.* ðŸ‘€ðŸŽ¹ðŸ’–

Built with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and the web MIDI API. This project is a work in progress, because I'm using this to [learn Elm](https://elm-lang.org)!

***Important note:** The Web MIDI API pretty much only works in Google Chrome and Opera for now. (See [CanIUse.com/#feat=midi](https://caniuse.com/#feat=midi) for details on cross-browser support.)*
