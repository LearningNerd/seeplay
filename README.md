# SeePlay

*Learn to sight-read sheet music with your MIDI instrument!*

This project is a work in progress, because I'm using this to [learn Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org)!

## Development setup

  1. Make sure you have Nodejs installed: `node --version`
 
  1. Install the latest version of Elm by [following these instructions from the official Elm docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) 

  1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LearningNerd/seeplay.git`
  
  1. Go to the project directory (`cd seeplay`) and run `npm install` to download dependencies
